### 01 Variables

A variable is a name that can reference a specific value. Variables are declared using `var` followed by the variable's name.

Here's an example:

```js
var example;
```

The above variable is **declared**, but it isn't defined (it does not yet reference a specific value).

Here's an example of defining a variable, making it reference a specific value:

```js
var example = 'some string';
```

###### NOTE 

A variable is **declared** using `var` and uses the equals sign to **define** the value that it references. This is colloquially known as "Making a variable equal a value".

###### The challenge:


In your cloud 9 workspace edit the file  `/home/ubuntu/workspace/code/tasks/01/app.js`.

In that file declare a variable named `example`.

Make the variable `example` equal to the value `'some string'`.

Then use `boscode.display()` to print the `example` variable to the console.

Check to see if your program is correct.
