### 03 Decisions 1

```js
if (condition) 
{
    // if condition is true
    // do this code
}
else // "otherwise"

If your condition is true, use boscode.display() to print "The condition ist true.".

Otherwise (else) when it is false, use boscode.display() to print "The condition is false.".

Make sure your condition evaluates to true, so that your program prints out "The condition ist true.".

2) Review the pseudocode example [Binary selection](https://github.com/Quobject/boscode/blob/master/docs/pseudocode.md#binary-selection)

In your cloud 9 workspace edit the file  `/home/ubuntu/workspace/code/codecademy-tasks/03/pseudocode.txt`.
