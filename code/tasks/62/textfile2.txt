belly jeans
bat flattery
flutter by
pop corn
this is the fun part
my spoonerism generator
a lack of pies
go and take a shower
i hate with my mind
pain in the posterior
anthropomorphism 
hickory dickory dock
the rain in spain falls mainly on the plain
pack my box with frumpy dozen lusty jugs
strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government
this caged parrot is no more
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
back home after jiving she expired with quizzicality
